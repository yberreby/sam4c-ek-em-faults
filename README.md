# SAM4C-EK Electromagnetic Fault Injection

This is a second-year project I conducted at Télécom Paris under the supervision of Prof. Laurent Sauvage and then-PhD-student Oualid Trabelsi.

The goal was to run electromagnetic fault injection experiments on the SAM4C-EK; this work contributed to section 4.7 of [Oualid's thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03376512/document).

This code is provided as-is, in its original state, for informative purposes. It depends on external tooling and cannot be run out of the box without specialized hardware & corresponding software setup.
